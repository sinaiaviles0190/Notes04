# AWS Cloud Security
## Notes 04
### i. Key Points

#### Risks of poor Cybersecurity
- Malware can erase an entire system, causing important information to be compromised.

#### How to improve cybersecurity?
- Be aware of hackers/attacker/intruder. These individuals' intentions can vary, regardless, they are violating privacy.
- Malware or malicious code is files that can cause harm to a computer. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan Horses.
- How to detect malware?
- Requires you to open something like a link or email. Another form of malware can start infecting a user's computer by targeting software vulnerbilities. Malware can disguise itself as something it is not
- Vulnerabilities are flaws in (software,firmware,harware), attackers take advantage of these errors and infect computers.  

##### What you can do to minimize cyberattacks
-Keep software up to date, that way bugs and vulnerabilities can be fixed. Run up-to-date antivirus software; detects, removes and protects against malware. Strong passwords are useful so hackers cannot guess it so easily, changing usernames or passwords often is a good idea. Including  multi-factor authentification and installing a firewall adds extra protection. 

#### Security of the cloud
- AWS is in control of infrastructure (hardware,software,firmware). AWS is in charge of fixing infrastructure flaws, customers are responsible for fixing any application and configuring their own OS and apps.
- Customer specific: 
- physical data centers

#### IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Web service that helps you secure control access with those you chose.
- 

### ii. New Information
shared responsibility model: share the responsibility w aws to keep info secured.AWS is in charge of networks, infrastructure. 
- ISMS; Info security management systems
- principle of least privlidge: giving users limited amount of access
- need to protect data: at rest and in transit
